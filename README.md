Work orders Tracker "Lego":
Work orders tracker is a web application that allows the user to create, update, and delete work orders. The user can also see the work order status and add Notes to communicate between the user and the Adin to get updates on the work order.


Full Stack application, Backeend in Nodejs using Express and MongoDB. MVC pattern with endpoints and Models. The Frontend is a React Application with Tailwindcss and Redux to manage the state. Additionally, I added Token validation and Modal for Notes.


The MVP app is temporarily hosted by Render free tiers.
